Hi there!

I made this website to have an easy way to access my OSCP cheatsheets from multiple places. Because who can memorise all those commands!?
The main utilisation for this website is basic reference for commands and useful links which i have used before, not an explanation or a how-to guide for pwning of OSCP-like machines.

These pages are mainly created for my own use; but feel free to utilise, copy or fork!
